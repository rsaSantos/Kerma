Goals of task 1

1. Listen to incoming connections on port 18018
    - If a connection is received, read the data and print it to the console
    - Be able to handle multiple connections at the same time

    Questions: How to handle connections? How to store connection info?

2. Perform the handshake
    - When receiving connection
        - If its hello message, send hello back
        - After hello, send getpeers message
    - If protocol not followed -> invalid handshake error -> close connection

3. Discover and connect to new peers
    - Disconnect and connect again
    - Invalid messages -> error message w/ ? -> Disconnect?
    - Peers received are stored -> following requests will receive new peers
    - Create two simultaneous connections from same node -> how?
