Task 2 - List of tasks

- More verification checks before saving to peers.csv
- Handle current connections storage
    - Remove connections when exiting them on handle_connections
    - Should we keep the connections and peers.csv synchronized?
    - Ressuply connections:
        - ask for more peers to current connections?
        - try to connect to addresses in peers.csv, clean invalid/offline addresses
        (the previous two can be done in any order I guess, we can even try to connect,)
